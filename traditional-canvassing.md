I'll share what I know about traditional canvassing based on the provided documents and my knowledge, focusing on your specific questions.

## Traditional Canvassing Overview

Traditional canvassing typically involves brief, scripted interactions with voters, lasting about 60 seconds compared to deep canvassing's 10-20 minute conversations. It's one of several conventional outreach strategies used by political campaigns, alongside phone banking and mass media.

### Which sorts of races favor traditional canvassing?

Traditional canvassing is favored in races where campaigns need to reach large numbers of voters quickly, particularly:

1. General elections with broad voter outreach goals
2. Races with limited time before Election Day
3. Campaigns with tight budgets that prioritize quantity of contacts
4. Races where identifying supporters (voter ID) is more important than persuasion

Traditional canvassing has been the standard across most race types, but research suggests it's less effective in general elections for persuasion purposes compared to primary elections or special elections.

### Scale â€” how many canvassers in 2024?

The documents don't provide specific numbers for 2024 canvassers. However, we can make some estimates based on the information provided:

People's Action conducted approximately 350,000 deep canvassing conversations during their 2020 campaign. Given that traditional canvassing requires less time per contact (60 seconds vs. 10-20 minutes), the scale of traditional canvassing operations is typically much larger.

In presidential election years, campaigns deploy tens of thousands of paid and volunteer canvassers nationwide, with particular concentration in battleground states. The exact number for 2024 isn't specified in the documents.

### Is traditional canvassing effective?

Research suggests traditional canvassing has limited effectiveness, particularly for persuasion in general elections. A study by Kalla and Broockman analyzing 49 field experiments found "brief door-to-door canvassing and other traditional campaign methods had nearly zero effect on voting choices in general elections."

Traditional canvassing appears to be:
- More effective for voter identification and turnout than for persuasion
- Less effective in today's politically polarized environment
- Shorter-lasting in impact, with effects typically fading within 3-5 days in today's noisy political environment (compared to deep canvassing's 3-9 month impact)

### Is traditional canvassing cost-effective?

When comparing traditional and deep canvassing, researchers estimated that "deep canvassing by phone was 102 times more effective than classic presidential campaign persuasion tactics like advertising, direct mail, and brief canvassing." This suggests traditional canvassing has poor cost-effectiveness for persuasion purposes.

Campaigns traditionally evaluate field operations based on metrics like "contacts per hour" and "cost per contact," which favor quantity over quality of voter interactions. By these metrics, traditional canvassing appears cheaper, but when measuring actual persuasive impact per dollar spent, deep canvassing appears to be more cost-effective.

Traditional canvassing may remain cost-effective for:
- Basic voter identification tasks
- Get-out-the-vote efforts close to Election Day
- Campaigns with extremely limited budgets that need to maximize visibility
