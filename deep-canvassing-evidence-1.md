# Deep Canvassing Research and Evidence: A Comprehensive Review

## Introduction

Deep canvassing is an approach to voter outreach and persuasion that emphasizes longer, more empathetic two-way conversations rather than traditional brief, scripted interactions. This document compiles the key research studies, evidence, and implementations of deep canvassing to provide a comprehensive understanding of its efficacy, the conditions under which it has been used, and its potential applications in political campaigns.

## Origins and Development

Deep canvassing emerged from the LGBTQ+ equality movement in 2012 when staffers at the Los Angeles LGBT Center began having in-depth conversations with people who had voted against same-sex marriage. The approach was subsequently refined and studied by academics, who provided empirical evidence for its effectiveness.

## Key Research Studies

### 1. Broockman & Kalla (2016): Transgender Rights Study

**Study:** "Durably reducing transphobia: A field experiment on door-to-door canvassing"  
**Published in:** Science (April 2016)  
**Researchers:** David Broockman and Joshua Kalla  
**Settings:** South Florida  
**Method:** Door-to-door canvassing  

**Key Findings:**
- A single 10-minute conversation encouraging actively taking the perspective of others reduced prejudice against transgender people
- Effects persisted for at least 3 months
- The decrease in prejudice was greater than Americans' average decrease in homophobia from 1998 to 2012
- Both transgender and non-transgender canvassers were effective
- The intervention increased support for a non-discrimination law, even after exposing voters to counterarguments

This study was particularly notable as it came after a 2014 paper by Michael J. LaCour claiming similar effects was retracted due to falsified data. Broockman and Kalla's rigorously conducted study confirmed that the approach actually does work.

### 2. Kalla & Broockman (2017): Minimal Effects of Brief Campaign Contact

**Study:** "The Minimal Persuasive Effects of Campaign Contact in General Elections: Evidence from 49 Field Experiments"  
**Published in:** American Political Science Review  
**Researchers:** Joshua Kalla and David Broockman  

**Key Findings:**
- Brief door-to-door canvassing and other traditional campaign methods had nearly zero effect on voting choices in general elections
- This provided a stark contrast to deep canvassing and highlighted why alternative approaches were needed

### 3. Kalla & Broockman (2020): Immigration Study

**Study:** "Reducing Exclusionary Attitudes through Interpersonal Conversation: Evidence from Three Field Experiments"  
**Published in:** American Political Science Review  
**Researchers:** Joshua Kalla and David Broockman  
**Settings:** Multiple locations in Tennessee and California  

**Key Findings:**
- Deep canvassing conversations successfully reduced prejudice toward undocumented immigrants
- Effects lasted for several months
- Non-judgmental exchange of narratives was identified as a key mechanism for attitude change
- The approach was effective even when implemented by organizations with no prior experience with deep canvassing

### 4. People's Action 2020 Presidential Election Study

**Study:** "Deep Canvass Political Persuasion Experiment"  
**Conducted by:** People's Action in partnership with New Conversation Initiative  
**Evaluated by:** David Broockman and Joshua Kalla  
**Settings:** Phone canvassing in battleground states (Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin)  
**Method:** Deep canvassing by phone  

**Key Findings:**
- Phone-based deep canvassing led to a 3.1-point swing on average in favor of Joe Biden over Donald Trump
- The effect was even stronger among independents (5 points) and independent women (8.5 points)
- Deep canvassing by phone was estimated to be 102 times more effective per person than traditional presidential campaign persuasion tactics
- Pro-Biden messaging was more effective than anti-Trump messaging
- For every 100 completed phone calls, approximately three votes were added to Biden's vote margin

### 5. Climate Action Study in Trail, British Columbia (2022)

**Study:** Conducted by Neighbours United (formerly West Kootenay EcoSociety) in partnership with New Conversation Initiative  
**Settings:** Trail, British Columbia - a rural, industrial community  
**Issue:** Climate change and renewable energy transition  

**Key Findings:**
- Deep canvassing successfully built support for climate action in a community that might traditionally be resistant
- Following the campaign, the city council voted unanimously to transition to 100% renewable energy across all sectors by 2050
- First successful volunteer-based deep canvassing program specifically on climate issues

### 6. People's Action 2022 Election Lies Study

**Study:** Conducted by Deep Canvass Institute, People's Action, and researchers Broockman and Kalla  
**Settings:** Missouri, Idaho, and Georgia  
**Issue:** Countering Trump's election lies about mail-in voting fraud  

**Key Findings:**
- The experiment found a 4.2 percentage point increase in agreement with allowing all Americans to vote by mail after deep canvassing conversations
- Demonstrated deep canvassing's effectiveness on addressing misinformation and election integrity issues

### 7. Voter Outreach Impact on Canvassers (2022)

**Study:** "Voter Outreach Campaigns Can Reduce Affective Polarization among Implementing Political Activists"  
**Published in:** American Political Science Review  
**Researchers:** Joshua Kalla and David Broockman  

**Key Findings:**
- Deep canvassing not only affected the attitudes of voters but also changed the canvassers themselves
- Canvassers showed reduced polarization and improved attitudes toward those with opposing views
- "Perspective-getting" (hearing stories from people with different views) was identified as the key mechanism

## Conditions and Implementation Details

### Conversation Structure

Most effective deep canvassing programs follow a similar structure:

1. **Building rapport and non-judgmental listening:** Starting with open-ended questions and genuinely listening to responses
2. **Encouraging personal storytelling:** Both canvassers and voters share relevant personal experiences
3. **Connecting through shared values:** Finding common ground despite potential disagreements
4. **Perspective-taking exercises:** Asking voters to recall experiences of being treated unfairly or feeling marginalized
5. **Linking to specific policy or electoral choices:** Making the connection between shared values and the specific campaign goal

### Time Investment

- Typical deep canvassing conversations last 10-20 minutes, compared to 60-second traditional canvassing interactions
- The longer duration enables deeper engagement but limits the number of contacts possible

### Targeting and Demographics

Deep canvassing has been particularly effective with:

1. **Independent and undecided voters:** Shows highest persuasion rates with voters not firmly committed to a party
2. **Women:** The 2020 Presidential election study showed particularly strong effects among women (8.5% with independent women)
3. **Low-propensity voters:** Successful in engaging infrequent voters who may be disenchanted with politics
4. **Rural and small-town communities:** People's Action has focused on building bridges in rural communities that are often neglected by progressive campaigns

### Issues Addressed Successfully

Deep canvassing has proven effective across a range of issues:

1. **LGBTQ+ rights and reducing transphobia**
2. **Immigration policy and attitudes toward undocumented immigrants**
3. **Electoral choices in presidential and local elections**
4. **Climate change action and policy**
5. **Voting rights and countering misinformation about election integrity**
6. **Racial justice issues including reparations**

### Implementation Scale

- **People's Action 2020 Campaign:** Conducted approximately 350,000 deep canvassing conversations across battleground states
- **Changing the Conversation Together:** Implemented deep canvassing at scale to help flip Staten Island in 2018 and Pennsylvania in 2020
- **Trail, BC Climate Initiative:** Successful city-wide implementation leading to policy change

## Durability of Effects

A key advantage of deep canvassing is the longevity of its impact:

- **Standard canvassing effects:** Typically fade within 3-5 days in today's noisy political environment
- **Deep canvassing effects:** Studies consistently show impacts lasting 3-9 months after the conversation
- **Broockman & Kalla (2016):** Effects persisted for at least 3 months
- **Kalla & Broockman (climate study):** Effects lasted up to 9 months

This durability makes deep canvassing particularly valuable for campaigns with longer time horizons and for issues requiring sustained support.

## Comparative Effectiveness

- **2020 Presidential Election Study:** Deep canvassing was estimated to be 102 times more effective per person than traditional presidential campaign persuasion tactics
- **Traditional methods (TV ads, direct mail, brief canvassing):** Typically show less than 1% effect on voter preferences, and sometimes practically zero
- **Cost-effectiveness calculation:** While each deep canvassing conversation requires more time, the dramatically higher persuasion rate and durability can make it more cost-effective overall

## Challenges and Limitations

Despite its effectiveness, deep canvassing faces several implementation challenges:

1. **Resource intensity:** Requires more time per contact and more extensive volunteer training
2. **Scaling difficulties:** Harder to reach the same volume of voters as traditional methods
3. **Training requirements:** Volunteers need more substantial preparation to conduct effective deep canvassing conversations
4. **Campaign timeline pressure:** Campaigns often feel they don't have time for longer conversations, especially near Election Day
5. **Evaluation metrics:** Traditional campaign metrics prioritize quantity over quality of contact

## Best Practices for Implementation

Organizations that have successfully implemented deep canvassing at scale share these practices:

1. **Comprehensive volunteer training:** Focusing on active listening, empathy, and conversational techniques
2. **Script development:** Creating conversation guides that allow for natural flow while ensuring key points are covered
3. **Practice sessions:** Extensive role-playing before volunteers engage with actual voters
4. **Early implementation:** Starting deep canvassing campaigns months before Election Day
5. **Targeted approach:** Focusing on demographics and geographies where deep canvassing is most likely to be effective

## International Applications and Innovations

While most of the documented research on deep canvassing has focused on the United States, the approach has begun to spread internationally with promising applications in several countries:

### Canada: Climate Action in British Columbia

Neighbours United (formerly West Kootenay EcoSociety) in Canada has developed its own deep canvassing playbook and toolkit, implementing the approach to build support for climate action. Their work led to the first successful volunteer-based deep canvassing program specifically on climate issues, culminating in Trail, British Columbia's city council voting unanimously to transition to 100% renewable energy by 2050.

### Australia: Youth Climate Coalition

The Australian Youth Climate Coalition (AYCC) adapted deep canvassing techniques for the 2022 Australian election, developing specific scripts to engage voters on climate issues. Their approach shows how the methodology can be customized for different political and cultural contexts while maintaining the core principles of deep canvassing.

### United Kingdom and Europe

While traditional canvassing research has been conducted in the UK and Europe, formal deep canvassing studies are more limited in these regions. Research on traditional canvassing in the UK has found smaller effects than in the US context, suggesting the potential value of more effective approaches like deep canvassing. As deep canvassing techniques continue to spread globally, this represents an opportunity area for both implementation and research.

## Innovations in Deep Canvassing Approaches

Recent years have seen several innovations in how deep canvassing is implemented:

### 1. Application to Disinformation and Polarization

Organizations have begun adapting deep canvassing specifically to counter disinformation, recognizing that "disinformation thrives on stereotypes, scapegoating and soundbites" while deep canvassing offers a more nuanced approach. This represents an important evolution as campaigns increasingly need to address not just policy disagreements but fundamental disputes about facts.

### 2. Remote and Digital Adaptations

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated innovation in remote deep canvassing:

In 2020, the New Conversation Initiative partnered with People's Action to develop a deep canvassing approach that could work effectively by phone, finding it still maintained significant persuasive power despite the lack of face-to-face contact.

Organizations have also experimented with adapting deep canvassing techniques to text messaging, with Open Progress and #VoteProChoice piloting "an innovative new approach to doing deeper, more effective voter ID over text."

### 3. Training and Community Building

The establishment of the Deep Canvass Institute in 2021 has helped systematize training and knowledge-sharing, with "thousands of people and hundreds of organizations" participating in deep canvass training programs. These efforts have led to more than 245,000 deep canvass conversations around the country on topics ranging from climate to transgender rights to immigration.

### 4. Script Development Methodologies

Organizations have developed more sophisticated approaches to script development, including tools like "The Cone of Curiosity" that help canvassers structure conversations that draw out voters' personal experiences and values. These innovations help make deep canvassing more accessible to volunteers and more consistent in implementation.

## Conclusion

The evidence consistently demonstrates that deep canvassing can be a remarkably effective approach for changing minds and building support across a range of issues and electoral contests. While it presents challenges for implementation at scale, organizations that have invested in the approach have seen significant returns, both in terms of measurable persuasion and in building bridges across political divides. As the approach continues to spread globally and adapt to new challenges like disinformation and digital contexts, deep canvassing represents a valuable innovation in political outreach, particularly in our current era of polarization and low trust in traditional political messaging.
