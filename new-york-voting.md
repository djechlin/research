## Ranked Choice Voting (RCV)

### Scope of Implementation

Ranked Choice Voting is used in New York City for:
- Primary elections
- Special elections
- Local offices only, including:
  - Mayor
  - Public Advocate
  - Comptroller
  - Borough President
  - City Council

RCV is **NOT** used in:
- General elections
- State elections (State Assembly, State Senate)
- Federal elections (Congressional, Presidential)
- District Attorney races (which are state offices)

### How Ranked Choice Voting Works

1. **Ranking Candidates:**
   - Voters can rank up to 5 candidates in order of preference
   - Voters can still choose to rank only one candidate
   - Each candidate can only be ranked once

2. **Vote Counting Process:**
   - If a candidate receives more than 50% of first-choice votes, they win immediately
   - If no candidate receives more than 50% of first-choice votes:
     - The candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated
     - Voters who selected the eliminated candidate have their votes transferred to their next choice
     - This process repeats until one candidate has more than 50% of the votes

3. **Important Rules:**
   - Do not rank the same candidate multiple times (it doesn't help them)
   - Do not give the same rank to multiple candidates (may disqualify your ballot)

### Upcoming RCV Elections in 2025

- City Council primary elections (June 24, 2025)
- Special elections for vacant seats
- Mayoral primary (June 24, 2025)
